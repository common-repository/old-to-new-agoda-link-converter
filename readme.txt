Text links are the best and most proven way to drive high-converting traffic to your booking pages. Which is why we’re making it easy for you to update your text links today and maintain maximum monthly bookings by monetizing your existing and new blog posts.

**The Old-to-New Agoda Link Converter** is a simple plug-in that instantly converts old affiliate link structures to new link structures.

**New links are better than old ones**
We’ve improved the Agoda affiliate link structure to:
